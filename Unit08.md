**Unit 8: Writing** <span id="8"></span> 
*The writing section of the SAT consists of multiple choice questions
where you are required to find errors or improvements that can be made
to written passages.  Mastering English grammar is a process that can
require many years of practice, but this unit will cover some
grammatical rules that the SAT tends to test most often.  Becoming
familiar with and mastering these few rules will improve your writing
score, even if your grammar is not perfect.  The Writing section of the
SAT also includes an essay prompt.  This unit also covers important
rules for structuring and writing an essay for the SAT that will score
well.*

**8.3 Improving Sentences** <span id="8.3"></span> 
*These questions tend to focus on eliminating redundancy or wordiness
and misplaced or dangling modifiers from a sentence.  
  
 To eliminate redundancy, remove unnecessary words from sentences.  You
do not need two or more words saying the same thing (e.g. true fact,
large in size, new innovations, due to the fact that, various different,
important essentials, the future to come, etc.).  You can also eliminate
wordiness by using the active voice rather than the passive voice.  This
means placing the subject before the verb (or the individual completing
the action before the action).  For example, “He took the SAT” is active
voice, while “The SAT was taken by him” is passive voice.  
  
 To eliminate misplaced or dangling modifiers, pay close attention to
the structure of the sentence.  Make sure the subject being modified
(described) actually appears within the sentence and that adjectives are
as close as possible to the subjects being described.*

**8.4 Improving Paragraphs** <span id="8.4"></span> 
*These questions tend to focus on adding, combining, or moving sentences
(and sometimes paragraphs) within a reading passage.  Keep in mind the
grammatical rules you learned in the previous two subunits as they will
also be applicable here.  
  
 To combine sentences, first make sure the sentences are addressing the
same idea or concept (otherwise they should not be combined).  Then,
reduce wordiness by eliminating any redundancy between the sentences;
that is, use only the words that are necessary to get the idea of the
sentence across.  
  
 To determine where a sentence or paragraph best fits into a passage,
keep in mind the basic rules of main idea.  Each paragraph has its own
main idea, located most often in the first sentence (or topic sentence),
but sometimes in the last sentence, of the paragraph.  All sentences in
the paragraph should contribute toward that same idea.  Sentences that
contribute toward a different idea should be placed in a different
paragraph.  Also, the sentences should be ordered so that the ‘argument’
or examples supporting the main idea flow coherently, with each
sentence’s idea building upon the information of the previous sentence. 
Likewise, each paragraph in the passage should contribute in a
progressive fashion toward the main idea of the passage (usually found
in the introductory paragraph).  
  
 Also, remember that the entire paragraph (and passage) should be in the
same tense (past, present, or future), unless the author is explicitly
referring to an event that occurred (or will occur) at a different
time.*

    question and deciding which answer you believe is correct, click the
    “View Answer” link in the bottom right hand corner of the page to
    see the correct answer and explanation.  Take notes on any mistakes
    that you make, and why your choice was incorrect, so you will
    remember not to make the same mistake in the future.  
      
     Attempting these practice questions should take approximately 30
    minutes.
