**Unit 7: Probability and Statistics** <span id="7"></span> 
*Probability and statistics are the final mathematical topics important
to master in order to do well on the SAT.  These are not complicated
topics at all; you just need to know how to do them!  This unit will
show you how to easily answer any SAT question on probability or
possible permutations of an event, as well as how to determine the basic
descriptive statistics of a data set.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 3.75 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.1: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.2: 0.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.4: 0.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 7.5: 2 hours

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Calculate the probability of an event.
-   Calculate the probability of two or more events occurring in
    succession.
-   Calculate the number of ways an event can occur.
-   Calculate basic statistical values. 

**7.1 Probability** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: ErikTheRed.com: Erik Jacobsen’s “SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas”**
    Link: ErikTheRed.com: Erik Jacobsen’s [“SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas”](http://www.erikthered.com/tutor/) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and select the link to
    the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas” PDF.  Read the section entitled
    “Averages, Counting, Statistics, Probability” (page 2).  For all of
    these formulas, you should try substituting actual numbers for the
    variables, so you can see how the formulas would work for an actual
    problem.  This resource will cover the topics outlined in subunits
    7.1-7.3, as well as any inclusive sub-subunits.  
      
     Reading these sections, taking notes, and practicing the formulas
    should take approximately 30 minutes.

**7.1.1 One Event** <span id="7.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resource assigned below subunit
7.1.  As an example, use a scenario where you have 4 yellow balls, 3 red
balls, 5 blue balls, and 1 black ball inside a hat.  What is the
likelihood that you would pick each of the colors on your first draw?*

**7.1.2 Sequence of Events** <span id="7.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the resource assigned below subunit
7.1.  Multiply the probability of the first event by the probability of
the second event, third event, etc.*
