The SAT is a timed standardized test, taken by most students in their
junior or senior year of high school, often required for college
admission.  In the increasingly competitive college admission process,
students today are looking for any and all ways to improve their
candidacy.  One element of your college application that can definitely
be improved on to help your chances of admission is your SAT score. The
test is made up of 10 sections, drawn from three subjects: reading,
mathematics, and writing.  All of these subjects review topics you have
already learned in school: critical reading skills, arithmetic, algebra,
geometry, grammar, and essay writing.  You already have basic knowledge
on these subjects.  However, you can gain an extra edge and improve your
score by reviewing the specific material that will be covered on the
test and by becoming familiar with the rules and strategies specific to
correctly answering SAT questions. Doing well on the test provides
important information about you as a student to the admissions office. 
In a way, the SAT is testing not only your general preparation for
college based on your mastery of basic secondary school subjects, but
also your ability to prepare for a specific upcoming test (in this case,
the SAT).  The study skills you may have learned previously in school
and which will serve you well in preparing for the SAT will most likely
become the most important element in your ability to succeed in college.
First, this course will cover the basic knowledge needed in each subject
to do well on the SAT, as well as rules and strategies for answering SAT
questions.  The course will include a few practice questions within each
section to allow you to apply the covered concepts immediately.  Toward
the end of the course, you will practice many more sample questions for
each subject, as well as you will complete practice tests.  Remember
that the more you practice and the more you return to review the
subjects and topics that give you trouble, the more you will master and
the higher your score will be!

### Learning Outcomes

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2, as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
latter units.  You will also need to complete:  

-   Sub-subunit 3.2.3 Assignments
-   Sub-subunit 3.3.6 Assignments
-   Subunit 3.4 Assignment
-   Subunit 4.8 Assignments
-   Subunit 5.6 Assignments
-   Subunit 6.6 Assignments
-   Subunit 7.4 Assignments
-   Subunit 7.5 Assignment
-   Subunit 8.5 Assignments
-   Sub-subunit 8.6.2 Assignments
-   Subunit 8.7 Assignment
-   Unit 9 Practice Problems
-   Unit 10 Practice SAT Tests
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through all of the resources and practice tests in the course.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **46**
**hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to
complete Unit 1 (a total of 2 hours) on Monday night; Subunit 2.1 (a
total of 1.5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.
