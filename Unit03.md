**3.2 Sentence Completions** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Doing well on sentence completion questions requires a good vocabulary
and an understanding of sentence structure.  
  
 First, look for clue words in the sentence that give you an idea of
where the sentence is going, including transitional clue words such as
although, despite, because, even if, etc.  If you pay close attention to
these clues, you should be able to tell whether the words that fill the
blank are of positive or negative connotation, and you should be able to
come up with basic words of your own to fill in the blank (e.g. nothing
fancy, just words like good/bad, pretty/ugly, tall/short, etc.).  Do all
of this before you look at any answers.  Then, you can quickly go
through the answers, eliminating any that do not match the basic words
you came up with.  You should only be left with one or two, which you
can then check by trying the words in the sentence to see which fit
best.  
  
 For questions with two blanks, remember that if one word of the pair
does not work for the sentence, then the answer is wrong, no matter how
perfectly the other word fits.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this video
    for an illustration of the strategy you can use to break apart and
    solve sentence completion questions.  Remember to pay attention to
    clues within the sentence, find a basic word that could fill in the
    blank(s), and then go through the answers, eliminating choices that
    do not match the meaning of your basic word(s).  The strategy shown
    here is applicable to sub-subunits 3.2.1 and 3.2.2.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 15 minutes.

**3.2.1 One Word Completions** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 3.2. 
Remember to use clues from the sentence structure to determine a likely
simple word to fill the blank, and then find a matching word among the
answers provided.*

**3.2.2 Two Word Completions** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 3.2. 
In particular, remember that both provided words need to fit correctly
into the sentence.  If one word doesn’t fit, choose a different word
pair.  
  
 You can also look for relationships between the missing words in the
sentence to help you weed out incorrect answer choices.  For example, if
the sentence reads “Despite \_\_\_\_, John was \_\_\_\_,” you know that
the two missing words are expressing opposing ideas, since despite (and
although, and in spite of) indicates that the result was different than
might be expected.  Therefore, you can immediately eliminate all answer
choices where the two words do not show the relationship suggested by
the sentence, and focus your time on choosing between any answer pairs
that seem like a possible fit.*

**3.3 Critical Reading** <span id="3.3"></span> 
*The most important thing you can do to improve your score on the
critical reading passages is to look for the answers to the questions in
the text, rather than making guesses based on your own ideas,
assumptions, and inferences.  Because this is a multiple choice test,
your thoughts about the passage are outside of the scope of what can be
tested.  What is being tested is whether you can find the answers to the
questions within the text.  
  
 The questions are listed roughly in the order in which the answers
appear in the text, so you can use line questions (which indicate which
line in the text the question is referring to) as a guideline for where
you should be looking for answers to the preceding, intervening, and
subsequent questions as well.  
  
 Make sure that the answer you choose matches the author’s tone (happy,
melancholy, amazed, bored, objective, etc.), scope (level of detail --
not too broad, not too narrow), and purpose (main idea).  Finally, stay
away from extreme opinions or absolutes (always, never, all, etc.). 
These are traps and are never the right answer.  
  
 It is generally a good idea to read (or at least skim) the reading
passage before you begin answering questions, so that you have a basic
context and understanding of what the passage is about.  During your
initial reading, you can focus on determining the main idea or purpose
of the passage and the author’s tone, as understanding this basic
information is extremely helpful in quickly and correctly answering the
subsequent questions.  However, take some time to figure out what works
best for you.  If you get too bogged down in the initial reading, so
that you have very little time to answer the questions afterward, it may
be a better idea to just read the topic sentences of each paragraph, or
to look at the questions first so that you know what you are looking
for.  Try out each of these methods on your practice reading passages to
find which comes more naturally to you, and gives the best result in
terms of speed and correct answers.  
  
 For short reading passages, it is often recommended to look at the
questions first, because the answers are easier to find in the short
passage, even without a close reading.  Again, find what works best for
you.  You will be much more efficient and accurate if you use a
well-practiced strategy that comes naturally to you than if you try to
rigidly follow a prescribed strategy that feels awkward and confusing.  
  
 You should spend about 15 minutes reading and studying the information
and tips below subunit 3.3.*

**3.3.1 Main Idea/Purpose** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
*The main idea/purpose of an essay will often be indicated in the first
paragraph.  There may also be information relevant to the main idea or
purpose in the italicized introduction provided by the test before the
passage.  Check both of these for this information.  However, the best
way to find the main idea of any passage is to find the concept or point
that is relevant to every paragraph in the passage.  If part of the
passage is not relevant to a given idea, it is not likely to be the main
idea.  Be sure to check your first choice for main idea against the
actual passage before choosing an answer.*

**3.3.2 The Author “Suggests”** <span id="3.3.2"></span> 
*When you encounter a question asking what the author “suggests,” look
back at the passage to find which of the answers the author actually
says.  This will be the correct answer.*

**3.3.3 Word Meaning** <span id="3.3.3"></span> 
*Some questions will ask you to choose the best definition for a word
used in the reading passage, according to its context in the passage. 
Therefore, for these questions, pay very close attention to the
context.  Read the lines before and after to make sure you are clear on
the way the word is being used.  You should choose the definition that
matches the literal meaning of the word as used in the passage.  All of
the definitions offered will be possible metaphorical meanings of the
word.  Your job is to choose the definition that is not metaphorical in
this case.*

**3.3.4 All EXCEPT** <span id="3.3.4"></span> 
*The types of questions that ask “This passage/The author uses all ...
EXCEPT:” are the most time-consuming questions in the reading section. 
You need to actually go back to the passage, find examples of each
choice and check them off, until you are left with only one, which you
cannot find.  This will be the correct answer.*

**3.3.5 Dual Passage** <span id="3.3.5"></span> 
*Dual passages start with questions about the first passage, then move
on to questions about the second passage, and end with a few questions
which require you to relate the passages to each other.  For example,
the question may ask how the two authors’ tones or opinions on a subject
differed, or how their tones or opinions were similar.  Complete the
questions relevant to each passage alone first, as you would for a
single passage.  Read the passage, and find the answers for each
question.  Once these questions are completed, you will be very familiar
with both passages and ready to tackle the comparison questions.  
  
 As you answer the comparison questions, keep in mind each author’s
purpose, tone, and level of detail.  These basics should help you weed
out obviously incorrect choices quickly.  Then, be sure to check back to
relevant portions of each passage to ensure your answer choice is
correct before committing to it.*
