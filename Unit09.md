**Unit 9: Practice Problems** <span id="9"></span> 
*Now that you have worked through all of the knowledge that you need to
review for the SAT, you need to practice applying that knowledge.  This
unit contains many practice problems for each section of the SAT so that
you can get plenty of practice.  As you work through the problems, if
there is something that stumps you, make a note of what it is, and go
back to the relevant previous unit to review the material.  Try working
on these problems a few at a time for several short sessions.  That way,
you are more likely to maintain enthusiasm and focus, to actually go
back and review the material not yet mastered, and to retain the
reviewed information for a longer period of time.  Overall, make sure to
get plenty of practice!  Nothing will raise your score more than
practice.*
