    Link: ErikTheRed.com: Erik Jacobsen’s [“SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas”](http://www.erikthered.com/tutor/) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and select the link to
    the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas” PDF.  Read the sections entitled
    “Lines,” “Triangles,” “Circles,” “Rectangles and Friends,” and
    “Solids” (pages 4-6).  Make notes or flashcards of any concepts you
    need to review in order to remember for the test.  This resource

**6.1.1 Parallel and Perpendicular Lines** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 6.1.  In particular, review the formula
for slope, and the formulas for writing an equation in ‘point-slope’ and
‘slope-intercept’ form, as described under the “Lines (Linear
Functions)” heading.*

**6.1.2 Corresponding, Complementary, and Supplementary Angles** <span
id="6.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 6.1.
 Corresponding angles are angles with the same degree measure. 
Complementary angles are two angles that add up to 90 degrees. 
Supplementary angles are two angles that add up to 180 degrees.*

    Link: Khan Academy’s [“Finding Missing
    Angles”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/angles/v/finding-missing-angles) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: The basics of finding missing angles are pretty
    straightforward.  Please click on the link above and watch this
    short video to brush up.  Watch this video as many times as needed
    to understand how to find missing angles.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take less than
    15 minutes.

**6.2 Triangles** <span id="6.2"></span> 
**6.2.1 Right Triangles** <span id="6.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading assigned below subunit 6.1. 
Make sure you have a good handle on the ‘Special Right Triangles’
(mentioned on the worksheet and reviewed in videos below) and the
Pythagorean triples (explained below).  Knowing these values off the top
of your head will help a lot with shortcuts and speed when you encounter
right triangles on the SAT.*

-   **Web Media: Khan Academy’s “The Pythagorean Theorem”**
    Link: Khan Academy’s [“The Pythagorean
    Theorem”](http://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/triangles/v/the-pythagorean-theorem) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above, and view this video
    for a brush-up on how to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the
    length of a missing side on a right triangle.  Simplifying square
    roots is also covered – understanding how to simplify roots which
    are not perfect squares is important in order to select the correct
    answer on the SAT, since the answers are designed to be found
    without a calculator (and so will be written as simplified roots,
    rather than decimals).  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take less than
    15 minutes.

    Link: Math Open Reference’s [“Pythagorean
    Triples”](http://www.mathopenref.com/pythagoreantriples.html)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This page explains and lists the basic Pythagorean
    triples – the lowest values that fulfill the Pythagorean Theorem
    (and will be found as sides of right triangles) when all sides are
    whole numbers.  Become familiar with the Pythagorean triples and
    their multiples so that you can quickly solve simple right triangle
    problems, and recognize right triangles by the values of the
    sides.

     Instructions: Watch these two videos for a review of the “Special
    Triangles” and examples of how to work these types of problems.

**6.2.2 Equilateral Triangles** <span id="6.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 6.1.  In particular, review the
description of an equilateral triangle, as described under the
“Triangles” heading.*

**6.2.3 Isosceles Triangles** <span id="6.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 6.1.  In particular, review the
description of an isosceles triangle, as described under the “Triangles”
heading.*

**6.2.4 Congruent vs. Similar** <span id="6.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered below subunit 6.1.  Congruent triangles are
basically identical.  They have the same angle measures and are the same
size (the lengths of their sides are the same).  Similar triangles have
the same angle measures, but may be different sizes.  The lengths of
their sides may be different, but they are proportionately the same
(e.g. if triangle A’s hypotenuse is 3, then a twice as large similar
triangle would have a hypotenuse of 6).*

**6.3 Circles** <span id="6.3"></span> 
**6.3.1 Circumference and Diameter** <span id="6.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 6.1.  In particular, review the formulas
under the “Circles” heading.  Remember that diameter (*D*) is the length
of a straight line passing from one point on a circle, through the
midpoint, to a point on the opposite side of the circle.  It is
therefore twice the length of the circle’s radius (*r*).  The
circumference of a circle is equal to *πD*.*

**6.3.2 Midpoint and Angles** <span id="6.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 6.1.  In particular, review the formulas
for the length of an arc and area of a sector under the “Circles”
heading.  Try drawing a circle, and choosing some values for the arc or
angle or sector area, leaving one unknown you can practice finding by
using the appropriate equation.*

    (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: The SAT will often ask a question or two about
    finding distances or angles of chords or shapes inscribed inside a
    circle.  Please click on the links above and watch these videos,
    which provide important information that can help you solve such
    problems.  Be sure to take notes about any rules proven here that
    can help you with SAT problems.

**6.5 Perimeter, Area, and Volume** <span id="6.5"></span> 
*Note: List the formulas from “SAT Math Facts and Formulas” (under
subunit 6.1) to find area and volume for each shape.  Review and
practice these formulas.  The more quickly you can remember them on test
day, the more quickly you can complete the problems.*

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and watch this video
    to learn how to find the area of a polygon without its own specific
    area formula.  
      
     Watching this video and pausing to take notes should take less than

     Instructions: Please watch these videos for a quick tutorial review
    of the use of the volume equations found on the “SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas” PDF (subunit 6.1).  The first video includes finding the
    volume of a cube (starting at 2:30) and the second video covers
    finding the volume of a cylinder.
