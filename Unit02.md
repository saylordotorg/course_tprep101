**Unit 2: Vocabulary** <span id="2"></span> 
*Though there is no section on the SAT called “Vocabulary,” increasing
your vocabulary will automatically increase your score, particularly on
the Reading section.  For one, correctly completing the sentence
completions in the reading section requires you to know the definitions
of the words both in the sentence and in the provided answers. 
Increased vocabulary will also help you to better understand the
Critical Reading passages, as well as any words you are asked to define
in those passages.   
  
 There are about 500 vocabulary words that are most often included in
the SAT.  Focusing your study on these particular words will have the
most positive effect on your score.  After you go through your word list
and become familiar with the meanings, be sure to review the list at
least once a week until your test.  This repeated review will cement the
information in your head and will make it more likely that you will
remember the definitions on test day.*

This unit should take approximately 6.5 hours to complete. Practice time

    Words”](http://www.vocabulary.com/lists/23400) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this webpage,
    which provides 100 words frequently encountered on the SAT.  Scroll
    through the words and decide on a study plan which will allow you to
    learn all of them before your SAT.  You may want to write down the
    words you do not know well on a piece of paper (with a short
    definition), and divide the list up into 5-10 words at a time. 
    Then, study one group of words for a few days to a week before
    moving on to the next group.  Remember that the more frequently you
    revisit the words, the better you will remember them.  Aim to work
    on vocabulary once a day throughout your study period for about 15
    minutes at a time.  
      
     Creating your vocabulary list and study plan should take
    approximately 1 hour.

     Instructions: Please note that this resource is optional.  If you
    would like to study from a longer word list, or one that is already
    in printable form, you can use the one provided here.  Click on the
    link above, and then select the “Download and Print” link on the
    page to get a PDF version.  Again, consider how you will effectively
    study the list.  Divide the words up into smaller groups, so you can
    study frequently in short spurts.  
      
     Creating your vocabulary list and study plan should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

**2.2 Activities** <span id="2.2"></span> 
*You can use the activities available for your word list on
Vocabulary.com, or you can create your own.  A very effective way to
study and remember your words is to create and use flashcards.  Get some
3x5 or smaller index cards, and write the word on one side and the short
definition on the other side.  Go through the words, looking at the side
which shows the word, and try to come up with the definition.  Check the
other side of the card to see if you got it right.  Alternatively, you
can look at the side which shows the definition, and try to come up with
the word.  Study frequently this way, and you will pick up the words
very quickly!  Study activities for vocabulary should take no more than
15 minutes at a time, but should be repeated frequently.  You should
spend at least 2 hours and 30 minutes in total on practice activities
for studying vocabulary.*

**2.3 Quizzes** <span id="2.3"></span> 
*Again, you can use the quizzes available for your word list on
Vocabulary.com, or you can create your own.  Write down each word from
the group of words you are testing yourself on, put away your word list,
and try to write down a definition for each.  You can also try using
each of the words in a sentence or creating your own sentence
completions that require you to fill in the correct word.  Quiz yourself
at least once a week during your study period.  Include time for
vocabulary study and quizzes in your study plan schedule so that you
will not forget to continue this crucial portion of SAT preparation. 
You should spend at least 2 hours and 30 minutes in total on vocabulary
quizzes.*
