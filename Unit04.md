**Unit 4: Basic Math** <span id="4"></span> 
*The mathematics section of the SAT includes questions that require
knowledge of several mathematical subtopics.  First, before moving into
the more advanced subtopics, it is important to review some of the basic
mathematical concepts you probably learned in elementary and middle
school.  This unit is a quick refresher on these basic concepts, such as
order of operations, factors and multiples, fractions, roots, and
exponents.  Once you have reviewed and mastered this information, you
will be able to more quickly and accurately answer many SAT Math
questions.  You will also have a firmer foundation on which to build and
review more advanced mathematical concepts.*

**4.2 Order of Operations** <span id="4.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 4.1.  In particular, familiarize yourself
with the order in which portions of complex mathematical problems are
solved as described according to the “Order of Operations” listing.*

**4.3 Sequences** <span id="4.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 4.1.  In particular, familiarize yourself
with the formulas for finding “next number (or nth number) in a
sequence” as described according to the “Arithmetic Sequences” and
“Geometric Sequences” listings.  You may need to practice actually
plugging numbers into these equations (in place of the variables) in
order for them to make sense to you.  Play around with the equations
until they become second nature, so you can easily use them to solve an
SAT problem.*

    videos for a more in-depth explanation of methods for finding
    numbers in sequences.  “Equations of Sequence Patterns” explains the
    formula for arithmetic sequences.  “Finding the 100th Term of a
    Sequence” explains how to apply the arithmetic sequence formula to a
    commonly encountered sequence problem.  “Geometric Sequences”
    explains how to set up the formula for finding a number in a
    geometric sequence.  
      
     Watching these videos and pausing to take notes should take

**4.4 Factors and Multiples** <span id="4.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 4.1.  In particular, familiarize yourself
with the methods for factoring a number or finding common factors or
multiples of two or more numbers, as described according to the “Prime
Factorization,” “Greatest Common Factor,” and “Least Common Multiple”
listings.  Pick a few random numbers, and practice factoring and finding
common factors and multiples until it comes easily.  You should take
approximately 15 minutes to complete this activity.*

     Instructions: Please click on the links above and watch these
    videos for a review of fractions.  You may not have a lot of
    practice with fractions, because we so frequently use calculators,
    which give us answers in decimals.  However, fractions frequently
    appear on the SAT (partially because all SAT math problems are
    designed to be solved without a calculator), so it is imperative
    that you are comfortable using fractions.  
      
     Watching these videos and pausing to take notes should take
    approximately 45 minutes.

    memorize, and also practice writing the formulas out using numbers
    substituted in for each variable, so you can see how the formulas
    work using real numbers.  
      
     Reading this section should take approximately 15 minutes.
