**Unit 10: Practice Test** <span id="10"></span> 
*The only practice left to do now is to take an actual SAT test! 
Because the SAT is nearly 4 hours long, taking a practice test is a
definite time commitment.  However, without taking an actual test, you
will not know how you will react to an actual test-taking situation
where you have to complete each section within the designated time and
retain focus for the entire length of the test.  After you have finished
and scored your test, think about any problems you might have had in
focusing or completing the questions during the test, and then think
about how you can better address these issues next time.  Also, take the
time to review any material you forgot or had a problem with on your
test.  Please take the provided practice test to complete this course. 
The other practice test in this unit is made available for further
practice at your convenience.*
