**Unit 5: Algebra** <span id="5"></span> 
*One of the most important mathematical subtopics you need to master to
do well on the SAT is algebra.  Understanding how to solve an equation
or rearrange it according to your needs to solve a more complex problem
is one of the most basic and widely-applicable skills in mathematics. 
This unit will cover the basic algebraic rules and methods of solving
various types of equations, as well as graphing and solving functions.*

**5.4 Functions** <span id="5.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: ErikTheRed.com: Erik Jacobsen’s “SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas”**
    Link: ErikTheRed.com: Erik Jacobsen’s [“SAT Math Facts and
    Formulas”](http://www.erikthered.com/tutor/) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the link above and select the link to
    the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas” PDF.  Read the sections entitled
    “Factoring, Solving,” “Functions,” and “Lines (Linear Functions)”. 
    Make notes or flashcards of any concepts you need to review in order
    to remember for the test.  This resource will cover the topics
    outlined in subunits 5.4 and 5.5.  
      
     Reading these sections and taking notes should take approximately
    30 minutes.

**5.5 Slope** <span id="5.5"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the “SAT Math Facts and Formulas”
reading assigned below subunit 5.4.  In particular, review the formula
for slope, and the formulas for writing an equation in ‘point-slope’ and
‘slope-intercept’ form, as described under the “Lines (Linear
Functions)” heading.  Understanding how slope describes a line in a
graph, how slope can be found within an equation, and how to write an
equation for a line in a graph will help you quickly understand
graphical transformations (where you are asked to find the formula for a
line that is similar to a line that you are given the formula for), as
well as other algebraic and graphical problems on the SAT.*
